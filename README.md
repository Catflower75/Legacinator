# Nefarius' Legacinator

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/03i0d6l2vgonx438?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nefarius/legacinator) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Nefarius/Legacinator/total)

The one and only Legacinator.

## About

Ever wondered why that darn game controller just won't show up in games, Steam or your favourite emulator? Machine crashes once you plug in a DualShock 3/4? Struggling with getting that lid off of your pickles jar? Well, I can't help you with that, but for the game controller issues, read on!

The Legacinator is a simple self-contained .NET 4.8 application that has one task: it scans your machine for traces of known legacy (outdated, potentially faulty) device drivers (leftovers from [ScpToolkit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit), outdated [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) copies etc.) and provide a solution to the user.

## Environment

This tool was built for **Windows 10**. Anything lower might work but is not supported. Since .NET 4.8 ships with Windows, the tool should be ready to run once downloaded.

## Download

ðŸš¨ **This is fairly young software so Anti-Virus might complain** ðŸš¨

## Usage examples

If you run the tool on a machine with legacy components, the window will fill up with one or more tiles listing components found:

Clicking them will either attempt an instant automatic fix or open a link to online articles on how to get rid of them in a safe and supported way. A few more detection examples:

On a "clean" machine you simply get a success dialog:
